      "message": "Could you add a README for this packages that explains the following points, derived from our conversation in chat:\n\nThe reasoning behind why generating sbat.csv is necessary as opposed to manually creating the file. (Avoids both needing a cargo.toml and sbat.csv, that have to be maintained and also guarantees no typos.)\n\nAlso explaining what differentiates this from the regular sbat package. Something along the lines that sbat_gen/sbat.csv is the sort of thing expected on all boot-related packages, and that sbat is the package that is the consumer of all the sbat.csv\u0027s from everywhere else.",
