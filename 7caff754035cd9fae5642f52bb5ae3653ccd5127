Perhaps since this isn\u0027t a generic csv parser, you might also want to clarify that this is not just your every-day implementation of a record, but rather one that describes an SBAT component.",

      "message": "1) There should be 3 \"/\"s\n2) Add this line: \"Any existing data is cleared before parsing.\" (Like you did for the metadata parser)\n\n*comments below this apply to both parsers *\n3) I think it would also be a good idea to specify the difference of the parse function of revocations and metadata in their respective function comments:\n- Revocations parser handles just the component \n- Metadata parser handles both the component and the vendor.\n4) In both function comments, specify what kind of raw CSV the parsers expect.\n5) Lastly, you might not agree with this, but I always appreciate having examples of inputs and outputs in front of parsing functions. Makes it easier to understand what they are doing.",
